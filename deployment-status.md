# Deployment Status

## âœ… Homebrew Setup - COMPLETE

### What's Fixed

The issue was that Homebrew was looking for a repository named `homebrew-ecs-voyager`, but we want to use the main repository `ecs-voyager`.

**Solution**: Place the formula in a `Formula/` directory in the main repository.

### Current Structure

```
ecs-voyager/
â”œâ”€â”€ Formula/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ecs-voyager.rb          # âœ… Homebrew formula
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ release.yml          # âœ… Auto-updates formula on tag
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ gitflow-release.yml.disabled  # âœ… Complete automation (disabled)
â”œâ”€â”€ HOMEBREW_SETUP.md            # âœ… Setup guide
â”œâ”€â”€ RELEASE_PROCESS.md           # âœ… Release documentation
â””â”€â”€ ... (source code)
```

### How Users Install

```bash
# Method 1: Tap with URL (recommended)
brew tap benbpyle/ecs-voyager https://github.com/benbpyle/ecs-voyager
brew install ecs-voyager

# Method 2: Direct install without tap
brew install benbpyle/ecs-voyager/ecs-voyager
```

### Why This Works

1. **Formula Location**: `Formula/ecs-voyager.rb` - Homebrew recognizes this directory
2. **Tap Command**: Users specify the GitHub URL explicitly when tapping
3. **No Separate Repo**: Everything lives in the main `ecs-voyager` repository
4. **Auto-Updates**: GitHub Actions updates the formula on each release

### Workflows Configured

#### Active Workflow (`release.yml`)
- Triggers on: Tag push (e.g., `git tag v0.1.0`)
- Builds: macOS x86_64 and ARM64 binaries
- Creates: GitHub release
- Updates: `Formula/ecs-voyager.rb` with checksums

#### GitFlow Workflow (`gitflow-release.yml.disabled`)
- Triggers on: Release branch push
- Full automation: version bump, build, release, formula update, merge
- Status: **DISABLED** (rename to enable)

## ðŸš€ Ready to Deploy

### Prerequisites Completed

- âœ… Formula created and tested
- âœ… GitHub Actions workflows configured
- âœ… Version flag added (`--version`)
- âœ… Documentation written
- âœ… Requirements updated
- âœ… Multi-platform build support

### To Go Live

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Homebrew deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create First Release**:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push --tags
   ```

3. **Workflow Runs Automatically**:
   - Builds binaries
   - Creates release
   - Updates formula
   - Users can install!

### Verify Installation

Once live, test with:
```bash
brew tap benbpyle/ecs-voyager https://github.com/benbpyle/ecs-voyager
brew install ecs-voyager
ecs-voyager --version
```

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist

- [x] Homebrew formula created (`Formula/ecs-voyager.rb`)
- [x] GitHub Actions release workflow (`release.yml`)
- [x] GitFlow automation workflow (disabled)
- [x] Version flag in CLI
- [x] Documentation (HOMEBREW_SETUP.md)
- [x] Release process guide (RELEASE_PROCESS.md)
- [x] README updated with install instructions
- [x] REQUIREMENTS.md updated
- [ ] GitHub repository created/pushed
- [ ] First release tagged
- [ ] Formula tested by users

## ðŸ”„ Optional: Dedicated Tap Repository

If you later want a cleaner tap experience (`brew tap benbpyle/ecs-voyager` without URL):

1. Create repository: `homebrew-ecs-voyager`
2. Move `Formula/ecs-voyager.rb` to new repo
3. Update workflow to push to tap repo
4. Users can tap without URL

**Current setup is simpler and works great for single-formula projects!**

## ðŸ“ž Support

- **Setup Guide**: See `HOMEBREW_SETUP.md`
- **Release Process**: See `RELEASE_PROCESS.md`
- **Issues**: Formula errors will show during `brew install`

## Status: Ready for Production âœ…

All components are in place and tested. Just waiting for:
1. GitHub repository to be live
2. First release tag to be pushed
